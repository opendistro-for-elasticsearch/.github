## It's time to upgrade to [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/)!

The Open Distro project bundled open source distributions of Elasticsearch and Kibana with Apache-2.0-licensed plugins that gave users enterprise-grade features, security, and analytics tools. In the two years since it launched, builders all over the world have used Open Distro to power their applications.

Open source Elasticsearch and Kibana 7.10.2 will soon be end of life, and are no longer receiving active development, security patches, or bugfixes. **All users** should be running software that receives timely security patches. The OpenSearch project was launched to provide a path forward for open source Elasticsearch and Open Distro users that ensures they always have access to security and new innovation.

Now is the time to migrate to OpenSearch to take advantage of the newest features, performance improvements, bugfixes, and security patches. See [what's so great about OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest#why-use-opensearch) and [get help migrating](https://opensearch.org/blog/technical-posts/2021/07/how-to-upgrade-from-opendistro-to-opensearch/).
